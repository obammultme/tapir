However, before you use any software to reset the ink level of your Canon printer, you should check the actual condition of your ink absorber. The ink absorber is a sponge-like component that absorbs the excess ink from the print head. Over time, the ink absorber can get full and cause errors or poor print quality. To check the ink absorber, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the front cover of your Canon printer and locate the ink absorber. It is usually located at the bottom right corner of the printer.
2. Gently press the ink absorber with your finger and see if it is wet or dry. If it is wet, it means that it is full or nearly full and needs to be replaced. If it is dry, it means that it still has some capacity and can be reset.
3. If you need to replace the ink absorber, you can either buy a new one from a Canon authorized service center or clean the old one yourself. To clean the old one, you need to remove it from the printer and wash it with water until it is free of ink. Then, let it dry completely before putting it back into the printer.

Resetting the ink level of your Canon printer can help you extend its life and save money on ink cartridges. However, you should do it responsibly and only when needed. You should also check and maintain your ink absorber regularly to avoid any problems with your printer. By following these tips, you can enjoy your Canon printer for a long time.
